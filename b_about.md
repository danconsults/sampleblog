### Can our work and passions meet?

Sometimes working feels like a (bad) neccesity, or an un-avoidable obligation. The secret is in finding the junction where work and passions meet, and then setting up a blog to find like-minded people. This is my junction in which i connect my career to my passions. 

Feel free to contribute and maybe we shall find a bigger junction to suit us all.
