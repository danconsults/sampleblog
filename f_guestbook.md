## Hi, welcome to leave a message here.:)

Below is an interesting quote from socrates (Philebus) about work and pleasure. (Work in this case means the effort required to convert data to infromation and wisdom). I also think that the conslusion applies to many big-data projects. :D

>   Philebus was saying that enjoyment and pleasure and delight, and the class of feelings akin to them, are a good to every living being, whereas I contend, that not these, but wisdom, intelligence, memory, and their kindred, right opinion and true reasoning, are better and more desirable than pleasure for all who are able to partake of them, and that to all such who are or ever will be they are the most advantageous of all things
